# Dr.M App - Wellness & Practice Management Platform

## Overview
Dr.M App is a mobile-first wellness platform for spiritual practices, meditation, and personal growth. It provides guided programs, community features, challenge tracking, and personalized insights. The platform aims to offer a holistic ecosystem for personal transformation through structured programs, emotional mastery, money mindset rewiring, workshops, masterclasses, and community sessions. Users can track progress, create playlists, engage in challenges, and develop their "Project of Heart."

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform uses a mobile-first responsive design with `max-w-md` container width. Typography includes Inter/DM Sans for body text and Crimson Text/Playfair Display for headlines. Color themes feature gradients for wellness sections, a purple accent (#703DFA), and a light gray background with white cards. Common components include fixed bottom navigation, gradient action cards, expandable practice cards, progress bars, streak calendars, modal dialogs, and segmented controls. The "Project of Heart" vision tab incorporates an Anahata Heart Chakra SVG. The Admin Panel has a desktop-optimized interface with sidebar navigation.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. State management uses React hooks and localStorage. The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript. Data storage is a hybrid: browser localStorage for user-specific data, and PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for community sessions, articles, categories, and CMS content. Admin panel authentication uses password-based bearer tokens, while the public app is authentication-free. An `AudioPlayer` component manages audio. AI video integration uses a custom chat interface connected to an external Gradio-hosted AI video generation service. PDF uploads are converted to HTML using `pdf2json` for inline display. Web Push Notifications are powered by Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

### Feature Specifications
Core pages include Home, Courses, Profile, Progress Insights, Project of Heart, Community Practices, and the Admin Panel. The Admin Panel offers CRUD for Articles and Categories, and a robust Course Management System (CMS) with a hierarchical structure (programs, courses, modules, folders, lessons, files). A Frontend Feature Mapping System links CMS courses to user-facing features. A global search system allows content discovery. A Daily Quotes system provides rotating homepage quotes. User progression includes streak tracking and custom playlist creation. The application supports Capacitor for mobile deployment.

**Consistency Calendar**: Displays user activity history, showing one month at a time. It uses warm amber/yellow for active days, light grey for inactive, and a flame icon for streaks >= 7 days. Today is highlighted in purple. It's read-only, sourcing data from backend APIs.

**Project of Heart (POH)**: A psychology-driven, single-scrolling page for personal vision and goal setting.
- **UI Flow**: Guides users from creation (Category → Title → Why) to managing an active POH with identity/vision images, milestones, actions, and daily ratings. It includes modals for milestone creation, completion, POH completion/closure, and creating "Next" or "North Star" POHs.
- **Interactive Features**: Vision image uploads, clickable milestones, inline editable actions, and a daily rating slider.
- **Psychological Flow**: Meaning → Identity → Emotion → Direction → Action → Reflection → Hope → Continuity.
- **Backend Implementation**: Four tables (`project_of_hearts`, `poh_milestones`, `poh_actions`, `poh_daily_ratings`) with foreign key constraints manage POH data. A defined status flow (active → completed/closed_early | next → active | horizon → next) includes auto-promotion logic. API endpoints support CRUD operations, daily ratings, milestone management, and POH completion/closure.

**Progress Insights**: Tracks only PROCESS and PLAYLIST activity types.

**Daily Abundance Challenge (Video-First Guided Journey)**: Netflix-like immersive learning experience for Money Manifestation Challenge and similar courses.
- **Database**: `lesson_progress` table stores userId, lessonId, completedAt.
- **Routes**:
  - `/challenge/:courseId` - Video-first experience (auto-opens first incomplete lesson)
  - `/abundance-mastery/course/:courseId` - Legacy module browser (fallback)
  - `/course/:courseId/module/:moduleId` - Individual module lessons
- **API Endpoints** (JWT authentication required):
  - `GET /api/v1/lesson-progress` - Returns {completedLessonIds: number[]}
  - `POST /api/v1/lesson-progress/:lessonId/complete` - Mark lesson complete
- **UI Layout (VideoFirstChallengePage)**:
  - Top 60%: Large video/audio player with auto-play
  - Bottom 40%: Compact timeline navigator showing all days
  - Lesson title as "Day X – Title"
  - No dropdowns, no nested module screens
- **Adaptive Multi-Resource Lessons**: Each lesson can include video, audio, and/or PDF
  - Primary Player: Video if exists, else audio, else PDF-only view
  - Resources Section (below player): Shows "Script (PDF)" and "Audio Version" if available
  - Audio appears as resource only when video is primary (switch to audio without leaving screen)
  - PDF opens in new tab/viewer
- **Timeline Navigator**: ✓ completed (green), ▶ current (highlighted), 🔒 locked (future)
- **Auto-Completion Logic**: Triggers at 90% video/audio progress, shows success toast, auto-advances
- **Completion Screen**: Trophy celebration when all lessons done, "Rewatch from Day 1" option
- **CMS Compatibility**: Flattens courses → modules → lessons into linear "days" on frontend only

**Event Calendar**: Displays live sessions and recordings.
- **Tabs**: "Upcoming" for current/future events, "Latest" for completed events with recordings.
- **Live Status**: Calculated dynamically.
- **Access Control**: Events can require specific program codes.
- **Admin Management**: Full CRUD for events, including thumbnail upload to R2.

**Dr.M Monthly Questions**: Allows users to ask one question per month and receive voice-recorded answers.
- **Database**: `drm_questions` table stores question details, user ID, status, and R2 key for the audio answer.
- **User API**: Endpoints to get user questions, specific questions with signed audio URLs, and submit new questions.
- **Admin API**: Endpoints to list questions, get question details, get R2 upload URLs for answers, and confirm answers (triggering push notifications).
- **User Flow**: Submit question → Wait → Listen to answer. Push notifications alert users when answers are available.

### System Design Choices
The architecture uses RESTful APIs with distinct public and admin endpoints. React Query handles efficient data fetching and caching. Components are modular and extensible. The database schema is structured with foreign key constraints to manage various content types (articles, categories, CMS elements, programs, feature mappings).
