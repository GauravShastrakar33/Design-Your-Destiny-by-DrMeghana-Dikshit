The changes must be applied only on this screen:
Location in the app: HomeScreen → Money Mastery Hub → Rewiring Belief

Update the Rewiring Belief screen UI as follows:

1. Keep the top motivational header:
    * Title: “Let's rewire that mindset, Champion!”
    * Increase the font size slightly for Subtitle not more 
    * Subtitle: “Left tap fear, Right tap faith” 
Add two small premium icons on the right side of subtitle 
brain 🧠 and ⚡ Lightning Bolt 
• Left side does not any symbol • Keep it minimal, clean, and premium


2. Remove the current belief input section from the main screen. The form should only appear in a popup modal when adding or editing a belief.


3. On the main screen, show only the belief cards:
    * Full width card
    * Rounded corners
    * Displays ONE belief at a time:
        * Title: “Limiting Belief” OR “Uplifting Belief”
        * Belief text large and centered

Inside each belief card, add a toggle button.
Create a boolean state (e.g. showUplifting).
When user presses the button:
- If showUplifting is false: display Limiting Belief and button label: “Show Uplifting Belief”
- If showUplifting is true: display Uplifting Belief and button label: “Show Limiting Belief”
Update UI instantly when toggled.


4. Inside each card, bottom-right:
    * Add Edit ✏️ button
    * Add Delete 🗑️ button
    * These replace the previous hide option (remove hide feature completely)

5. Remove “Add New Belief” button text. Replace with a floating round + button centered below the cards. This always opens the popup modal for adding a belief pair.


6. In the popup modal:
    * Show fields for Limiting Belief & Uplifting Belief
    * Include:
        * Save button 
        * Close(X) button

7. Ensure belief cards appear stacked if multiple beliefs exist. Users can scroll through older beliefs.

8. Do not modify navigation: Location stays: Home → Money Mastery Hub → Rewiring Belief

Goal: A clean, focused mindset reinforcement experience. No clutter. No confusing options. One belief message visible at a time.
