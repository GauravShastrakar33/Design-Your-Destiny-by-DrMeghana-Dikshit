Replace Admin Dashboard with New Minimal Dashboard
Context
* A dashboard screen already exists and must be fully replaced
* The goal is a minimal, non-overloaded, read-only dashboard
* POH has a separate analysis section and must NOT appear here
* This dashboard is for awareness, not actions or analytics

🎯 TASK 1: Replace Existing Dashboard Screen
Completely remove the current dashboard content, including:
* Total Sessions card
* Quick Actions section
* Any charts
* Any recent activity list
* Any analytics widgets
Then rebuild the dashboard UI from scratch using the structure below.

🧱 NEW DASHBOARD LAYOUT (FINAL)
1️⃣ KPI STRIP (Top row – 4 cards only)
Display these four KPIs in a single horizontal row:
1. Users
    * Total registered users
2. Active Today
    * Unique users who opened the app today
3. Practised Today
    * Unique users who completed at least one practice today via:
        * Processes section OR
        * Playlist section
    * Count each user only once
4. Badges Earned Today
    * Total badges awarded today
⚠️ Do NOT show practice types, breath, checklist, or breakdowns.

2️⃣ Events Section
Title: Events
Show two simple blocks:
* Events Today
* Upcoming Events (Next 7 Days)
Each event row should show:
* Event title
* Date & time
* Status (Upcoming / Live / Completed)
Read-only. No actions.

3️⃣ Notifications Section
Title: Notifications
Show two simple health indicators (read-only):
1. Notification Health
* Definition: Failed notifications are delivery attempts where notification_logs.status = 'failed'.
* Display logic (time-bound: last 24 hours):
    * If no failures → ✓ All notifications sent successfully (last 24h)
    * If failures exist → ⚠️ X notification(s) failed (last 24h)
* This represents delivery failures, not scheduling issues and not users disabling notifications.

2. Notification Permissions
* Definition: Count of users who have disabled notifications or do not have an active device token.
* Display logic:
    * Show a simple count, for example: 🔕 Y users have notifications disabled
* This is a separate indicator from failed notifications and should not be mixed with delivery failures.


4️⃣ Community Practices Section (Separate)
Title: Community Practices
Show:
* Total Community Practices
Meaning:
* Total number of practices created in the Community Practices section
* This is a content count, not usage or activity

5️⃣ CMS Health Section
Title: CMS Health
Show exactly three items:
* Courses – total courses created
* Published Courses – courses visible to users
* Last Updated Lesson – lesson title + relative time (e.g. “2 hours ago”)
No editing controls.

❌ Explicit Exclusions (Do NOT add)
* No Quick Actions
* No Recent Activity feed
* No Analytics charts
* No POH metrics
* No admin actions
* No practice type breakdowns
* No community usage stats
This dashboard must remain calm, minimal, and scannable in under 10 seconds.

🎯 TASK 2: Update Sidebar Navigation
Remove the following submenu items from the sidebar submenu section:
* ❌ Overview
* ❌ Analytics
* ❌ Recent Activity
