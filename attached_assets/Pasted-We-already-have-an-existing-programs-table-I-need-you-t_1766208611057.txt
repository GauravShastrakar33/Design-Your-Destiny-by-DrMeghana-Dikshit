We already have an existing `programs` table. 
I need you to MODIFY it (not recreate it) to make it future-ready for access control and Events.

====================================================
CURRENT TABLE (EXISTS)
====================================================
programs
- id (serial, primary key)
- code (varchar, unique)
- name (varchar)

====================================================
GOAL
====================================================
- Program `code` must act as a permanent business identity (USM, DYD, etc.)
- Programs must support soft delete / archive
- Programs must NOT break Events or access control if deleted & recreated
- Existing data must remain intact

====================================================
REQUIRED CHANGES (MANDATORY)
====================================================

1️⃣ ADD the following columns to the existing `programs` table:
- is_active (boolean, default true, not null)
- deleted_at (timestamp, nullable)
- created_at (timestamp, default now, not null)
- updated_at (timestamp, default now, not null)

2️⃣ DO NOT remove or rename:
- id
- code
- name

3️⃣ ENSURE:
- `code` remains globally UNIQUE (even for soft-deleted rows)
- `code` is treated as a permanent identity

====================================================
BUSINESS RULES (IMPORTANT)
====================================================

- Program `code` can be edited ONLY if the program is not used anywhere.
- A program is considered "used" if:
  - It exists in `user_programs`
  - OR it is referenced by any Event (future table)

- If a program is used:
  - Code must be READ-ONLY
  - Program must NOT be hard deleted
  - Only soft delete is allowed

====================================================
SOFT DELETE BEHAVIOR
====================================================
When admin deletes a program:
- Set is_active = false
- Set deleted_at = NOW()

When admin reactivates a program:
- Set is_active = true
- Set deleted_at = NULL

DO NOT hard delete used programs.

====================================================
IMPORTANT DESIGN NOTE
====================================================
- Program IDs may change, but program CODES must never be reused.
- Access control and Events will rely on program.code, not program.id.

====================================================
DELIVERABLES
====================================================
- SQL / migration to alter the existing programs table
- Updated Drizzle schema for `programs`
- Ensure no existing data is lost

Proceed safely. Do NOT drop or recreate the table.
