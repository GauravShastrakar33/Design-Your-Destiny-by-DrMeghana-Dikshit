### Project of heart

Update the image gallery inside the “Your Vision” card so that it shows only one full image and one half-visible image before scrolling.
Keep the design style exactly as before — rounded, soft, and minimal — but make the images significantly larger for an immersive, “vision-board” feel.
The gallery must still support up to 4 images horizontally with smooth scroll.
Add 3 dummy images

Upgrade the Journey tab inside the “Project of Heart” feature so that the “Start Your Journey” card becomes a full-width CTA button.
When clicked, it opens a modal asking the user a question.-> “What actions will you take this week toward your vision?”
After submitting an answer, a success popup message appears - “Congratulation Champion ! Choose yourself, every single day."
and the card transforms into a beautifully styled action card showing the user’s entered action.

Final Results
 Before: “Start Your Journey” full-width CTA On click: Modal → question input On submit: Congratulatory popup message After: Beautiful card replaces CTA, showing user’s weekly action

### Reset button - project of heart (demonstration purpose)

Create one reset button when clicked on it Project of heart starts from the beginning from 0 stars
And everything starts from the start Put that reset POH button in Profile screen -> Settings card -> Account
I want to add a Reset Project of Heart feature for demonstration purposes. Please do the following:
Add a “Reset POH” button inside the Profile screen, specifically under: Profile → Settings card → Account section
The button text should read: Reset Project of Heart
When this button is clicked:
The entire Project of Heart progress should reset to its initial state, as if the user is starting fresh.
Set stars = 0 and clear any locally stored progress.
for example, clear data stored in localStorage or relevant state variables
After reset, show a simple confirmation alert:
Project of Heart has been reset successfully.
Make sure this button does not break navigation or user data outside POH, and only resets the Project of Heart–related data.
