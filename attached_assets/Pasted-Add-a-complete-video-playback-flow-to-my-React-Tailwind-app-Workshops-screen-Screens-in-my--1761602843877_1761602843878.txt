Add a complete video playback flow to my React + Tailwind app.

### Workshops screen

Screens in my current app:
• Workshops Screen (shows cards for “Upcoming”, ”Latest", "DYD", "USM", "USC”, ”USB”, “more”) • Course Overview Screen (only for collection cards) • Now create a new: Video Player Screen


1.Create a new Video Player Screen : VideoPlayer.tsx
Requirements: • Play videos using YouTube URLs • Automatically resume from last watched position (saved in localStorage) • Playback speed options: 0.5x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x • Show video information:
* Title
* Author (optional)
* Description (optional) • Full responsive layout matching my current UI style • Hide the Last Watched reminder bar when this screen is visible


2.Navigation Rules for workshop cards
Every workshop card already has: • Thumbnail • Title • Coach Name • YouTube video URL (for single-video cards)


Add a new property to each card:
isCollection: true | false
Behavior:
1. If card.isCollection = false • Navigate directly to the Video Player screen
2. If card.isCollection = true • Navigate to Course Overview screen instead • In Course Overview, each lesson play button should navigate to Video Player screen
• “Latest” section cards → direct to Video Player • “DYD / USM / USC / USB / More” collection cards → go to Course Overview first

Data passed when navigating:
url
title
author
description
thumbnail
videoId


New Route
Add a new route:
<Route path="/video-player" element={<VideoPlayer />} />


3.Add a Last Watched Reminder Bar (not a mini player)
Purpose: • Show what video the user last watched • Help them quickly return to the content
Behavior & UI: • Only show this bar on the Workshops Screen • Fixed at the bottom above the bottom navigation bar • Bar shows:
* Thumbnail
* Title (one line)
* Watched time formatted (MM:SS)
* ▶ Play button → open Video Player, resume automatically
* ✖ Close button → hide bar until next watch session • If user completes video (>95%), remove the reminder

Storage:
localStorage.setItem("last-watched", {
  videoId,
  title,
  thumbnail,
  author,
  progressInSeconds
})


4.Add a new demo card in the “Latest” section
• Include thumbnail image I provided in attachments. • Include title : How to make Right Decisions
   author : Dr. Meghana Dikshit • On click → opens Video Player screen • Use this YouTube URL (temporary for testing): https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxZf04eoPrPNBBU3C4WYdt-08MnPre8vDa
