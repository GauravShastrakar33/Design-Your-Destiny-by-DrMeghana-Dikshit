I already have an Admin Portal with User Management and a Students list page. When the admin clicks on a user name in the Students table, it should navigate to a User Details page.

🔹 EXISTING CONTEXT (IMPORTANT)
* Admin portal already exists
* User Management → Students list already exists
* Users table already exists
* Authentication & role-based access already exists
* Do NOT rebuild user management
* Extend the existing system only

🔹 NEW FEATURE TO BUILD

1️⃣ Admin User Details Page
Route

/admin/students/:userId
Navigation
* Clicking a user name in the Students list should navigate to this page

2️⃣ Database Design
Create a new table:

user_wellness_profile
Columns:
* id (primary key)
* user_id (foreign key → users.id, UNIQUE)
* karmic_affirmation (TEXT, nullable)
* prescription (JSON / JSONB, nullable)
* created_at
* updated_at
Rules:
* One row per user
* prescription must be flexible and nullable
* Do NOT enforce required JSON keys

3️⃣ Admin APIs (Protected)
Create admin-only APIs:
Get wellness profile
GET /admin/users/:userId/wellness-profile

Create or update wellness profile
POST /admin/users/:userId/wellness-profile
Behavior:
* If profile exists → update
* If profile does not exist → create
* Only admin users can access these endpoints

4️⃣ Admin User Details Page UI
A. Basic User Info (Read-Only)
* Name
* Email
* Phone
* Program
* Status

B. Karmic Affirmation (Editable)
* Large textarea
* Admin writes personalized karmic affirmation
* Save button persists to backend

C. My Prescription (Editable, Structured & OPTIONAL)
Prescription must be stored as flexible JSON.

❗ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION (VERY IMPORTANT)
* Morning, Afternoon, and Evening are OPTIONAL keys
* Admin is NOT required to fill all sections
* Backend must accept partial or empty JSON
* Missing keys simply mean no practices for that time
* Do NOT force empty arrays for missing sections

Example Valid Prescription JSON

{
  "morning": ["Vibration Elevation", "Neuro-coupling"],
  "evening": ["WCA 3", "Happiness Code 1"]
}

UI Behavior
* Show sections: Morning / Afternoon / Evening
* Each section allows:
    * Add item
    * Remove item
* If admin does not add items to a section:
    * Do not store that key in JSON
* Save button persists structured JSON

5️⃣ User-Side API (Read-Only)
Create user API:
GET /api/me/wellness-profile

Returns:
* karmicAffirmation
* prescription (as stored JSON)
User must not be able to edit this data.

6️⃣ User Profile Page (Frontend)
Update existing User Profile page to:
* Fetch data from /api/me/wellness-profile
* Render:
    * My Karmic Affirmation
    * My Prescription
* Show only prescription sections that exist and have items
* Hide sections that are missing or empty
Empty State
If no data exists:
“Your personalized practices will appear here.”

7️⃣ Permissions
Role	View	Edit
Admin	✅	✅
User	✅	❌
8️⃣ Non-Goals (Do NOT Build)
* No notifications
* No version history
* No analytics
* No redesign of existing admin user management
* No frontend editing for users

9️⃣ Acceptance Criteria
* Clicking user name opens admin user details page
* Admin can save affirmation & prescription
* Prescription supports partial sections
* Data persists correctly per user
* User profile renders admin-assigned content
* Works independently for multiple users

This is an extension to the existing system, not a rewrite. Follow existing folder structure, API patterns, and role checks.

🧠 Product Note (Implicit Intent)
This content is guidance-driven, not self-editable, and must feel personalized and authoritative.
