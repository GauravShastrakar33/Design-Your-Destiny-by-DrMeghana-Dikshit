### Process Checklist

Modify my existing file: `src/pages/ProcessChecklistPage.tsx`

Here is what I want changed on this page:

✅ 1. First-time User Experience:
• If no custom checklist is stored in localStorage (or API), show this full-screen intro instead of the practice list:

✨ Start Your Daily Practice Ritual

Hello Champion,  
Ready to build your own Process Checklist — the practices that truly matter to you?

This will help you:
• Stay consistent  
• Track your journey weekly & monthly  
• See your growth clearly

[ 🌿 Create My Process Checklist ]
---

When the button is clicked
follow this flow:
1. Open a Modal or New Page
* Show a modal (popup) or navigate to a new page.
* This page/modal lets the user select practices they want in their personal daily checklist.

Example layout:
Select Your Daily Practices:
☐ Gratitude Journal  
☐ Meditation  
☐ Mirror Work  
☐ Ho'oponopono  
☐ Affirmations  
[ ✅ Save My Checklist ]

2. Save User’s Selection
* When the user clicks Save My Checklist:
* Store the selected practices in localStorage as the user’s personal checklist (you can replace it with a database later). 

3. Show Only Selected Practices in Daily View
Show only the practices that the user selected in their checklist.

Example UI after saving:

┌─────────────────────────┐
| ← My Practice Log |
├─────────────────────────┤
| |"Today’s Practices" Header Card|
|
| ☑ Gratitude Journal |
| ☐ Mirror Work |
| ☐ Ho'oponopono |
| 
| [ Save Today’s Reflection ] |
| ✏ Edit Checklist |
├─────────────────────────┤
| 🏠 📚 🤖 ❤️ 👤 (Bottom Nav) |
└─────────────────────────┘


User should be able to tick or untick checkboxes

✅ 3. Add “Edit Checklist” feature:
• Add a small button/link: `✏ Edit My Checklist`
• Clicking it opens a modal or new screen where user can toggle practices from the full list.
• Allow them to Save / Cancel.

✅ 4. Store and load data:
• Save selected checklist to `localStorage.userChecklist` (array of strings)
• Track daily completed practices in `localStorage.dailyLogs` as:
  [
    { date: "2025-11-03", completed: ["Gratitude Journal"] }
  ]


✅ 5. Here are some simple but powerful UI upgrades you can apply to the list:
🎨 1. Better Checkbox + Text Alignment
* Use rounded custom checkboxes
* Slight hover effect for better interactivity
* Increase whitespace between items for breathing room
📦 2. Card Container Enhancement
* Add soft shadows (shadow-md) and smooth corner radius (rounded-xl)
* Use subtle gradient or soft border color
💜 3. Improve "Today’s Practices" Header Card
* Keep your purple gradient, but:
    * Add icon alignment
    * Add padding top & bottom for balance
    * Maybe add subtle glow/blur behind?

Make sure your final code:
• Has two states: firstTimeSetup or showChecklist  
• Allows editing checklist  
• Doesn’t show full practice list by default after setup
Do not remove navigation/footer.
