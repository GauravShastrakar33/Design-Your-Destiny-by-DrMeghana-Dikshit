Fix “Latest Events” Admin Behavior (Clear & Exact)

We have ONE events table.
Upcoming and Latest are filtered views, not separate entities.

1️⃣ EVENT CREATION (UNCHANGED)

When creating an event (Upcoming):

Visible fields

Title

Description

Coach / Host Name

Thumbnail upload

Start Date & Time

End Date & Time

Meeting / Join URL

Required Program

Status

Hidden fields

Recording URL

Recording Passcode

Recording Expiry Date

These fields must remain hidden during creation.

2️⃣ ADMIN → LATEST EVENTS (DECISION ZONE)

Latest Events is the post-event decision state.

Filter

Show events where:

status = COMPLETED

recording_expiry_date IS NULL OR current_time <= recording_expiry_date

CANCELLED events must NEVER appear

3️⃣ RECORDING DECISION PENDING (MOST IMPORTANT FIX)
Condition

recording_url IS NULL

show_recording = false

CURRENT PROBLEM

Each card incorrectly shows:

“USM only” → ❌

Edit / Join / Cancel buttons → ❌

REQUIRED CHANGES
Card content

Show program code only (e.g. DYD, USM)

Do NOT show the word “only”

REMOVE these buttons

Edit

Join

Cancel

SHOW ONLY TWO CTAs

✅ Add Recording

❌ Skip Recording

No other actions should appear.

4️⃣ ADD RECORDING FLOW (EDIT SAME ROW)

When admin clicks Add Recording:

Show input fields:

Recording URL

Recording Passcode

Recording Expiry Date

On save:

show_recording = true

Updated card state (Recording Published)

Condition:

show_recording = true

Card should now show:

“Recording available till <expiry date>”

Rules:

❌ Do NOT show “Skip Recording” anymore

❌ Do NOT show Edit / Join / Cancel

This is still the same event row, just updated.

5️⃣ ADMIN → LATEST VISIBILITY RULE

Admin → Latest must NOT show events after recording_expiry_date

Grace period applies ONLY to users, not admin

Expired recordings:

Disappear from Admin → Latest

Still exist in Admin → All Events

6️⃣ SKIP RECORDING — CONFIRMATION MODAL (MANDATORY)

Skip Recording must NEVER be instant.

On clicking “Skip Recording”

Show confirmation modal

Do NOT update anything until confirmed

Modal

Title
Skip Recording for this Event?

Message
This event will not have a recording and will not appear in Latest for users.
You can still add a recording later from All Events.

Buttons

Primary: Go Back

Secondary: Skip Recording

On confirm

Backend updates:

show_recording = false

recording_url = NULL

recording_passcode = NULL

UI behavior:

Event is removed from Admin → Latest

Event remains in Admin → All Events

Event NEVER appears in User → Latest

This action must remain reversible from All Events.

7️⃣ KEY CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT BREAK)

Single events table only

Latest is a state, not a new record

No duplicate events

No hardcoded program logic

UI state must be derived from DB fields only
