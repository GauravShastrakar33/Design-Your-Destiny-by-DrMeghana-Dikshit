### Level up section in Home Screen dashboard
Edit my Level Up section so that the 7-Day, 21-Day, and 90-Day challenge cards on the home dashboard navigate correctly and work with challenge tracking.
Do not change or remove existing cards — only add functional navigation and challenge persistence.

⚙️ Functionality to Add
1. When the user taps any Level Up card (7-Day, 21-Day, or 90-Day):
    * Navigate to a new screen named ChallengeDashboardScreen.
    * Pass the selected challenge info:
        * Challenge type (7, 21, or 90 days)
        * Challenge title (e.g., “7-Day Calm Mind”, “21-Day Mind Discipline”, “90-Day Life Transformation”)
2. On navigation, save challenge details into AsyncStorage using the key @app:active_challenge The saved object should include:  {
3.   "type": "21-Day Mind Discipline",
4.   "totalDays": 21,
5.   "startDate": "2025-10-25",
6.   "completedDays": 0,
7.   "streak": 0,
8.   "isCompleted": false
9. }
10.  

🪷 ChallengeDashboardScreen (New Screen)
Design a new screen called ChallengeDashboardScreen that shows:
* Challenge Title (from navigation param)
* Day Progress → completedDays / totalDays
* Streak Count → streak 🔥
* Circular or bar progress visualization based on progress percentage.
* Button: “Mark Day as Complete”
    * Increments completedDays by 1
    * Updates streak count
    * Saves back to AsyncStorage
    * Animates the progress ring

🎉 On Challenge Completion
When completedDays == totalDays:
* Show full-screen congratulatory modal: “🎉 Congratulations! You leveled up 🌟” 
* Move challenge data to a history key: @app:challenge_history
* Clear @app:active_challenge
* Add buttons:
    * “View History” → navigate to ChallengeHistoryScreen
    * “Start New Challenge” → navigate back to Level Up home

🗂️ ChallengeHistoryScreen (Optional)
If not already created, add a simple screen listing completed challenges stored in @app:challenge_history. Each card shows:
* Challenge name
* Completed date
* Streak length

🌼 Design Theme
Keep visuals aligned with your existing bright golden theme:
* Background: #FFFDF8
* Accent: #F4B860
* Buttons: gradient linear-gradient(90deg, #FFD580, #F8A14D)
* Text: #2E2C28
* Font: Poppins + Inter
* Animations: smooth fade transitions for navigation and progress updates.

✅ Expected Behavior
Action	Result
Tap on “7-Day Calm Mind”	Navigate to dashboard + start challenge
Mark Day as Complete	Update progress and streak
Finish Challenge	Show “Leveled Up” message + save to history
Reopen App	Resume from saved AsyncStorage data
💬 Developer Note
Do not modify existing Level Up cards or UI. Just add navigation, AsyncStorage saving, and ChallengeDashboardScreen logic. Keep all existing theme, layout, and animations consistent.

### Project of Heart

Create a “Project of Heart (POH)” digital growth journey feature in React + Tailwind.
Users define their heart’s purpose, plan actionable cycles, earn motivational stars, and optionally self-reflect.
Do not alter other screens or components. Just add this as a new elegant feature screen or section.

🧭 1️⃣ VisionBoard.tsx — Digital Vision Board
* A serene, heart-centered space for users to define their Project of Heart.
* UI:
    * Title input → “What is your Project of Heart?”
    * Description box → “Why does this matter to you?”
    * Optional image upload (acts as their Vision background)
    * “Set Vision” button (earns ⭐ First Star)
* Display affirmation: “Your heart’s vision is the seed of transformation.” 
* Show a glowing rose-gold heart symbol 💖 (centered, gently pulsing) representing energy of love & purpose.

🪞 2️⃣ JourneyPlanner.tsx — Cycles of Growth
* Three cycles → each with 4 weeks.
* Each week = a soft gradient card for entering reflections:
    * Actions Taken
    * Learnings
    * Wins
    * Next Step
    * Save button → stores locally
* Completing all 4 weeks in a cycle → earn 2 Stars 🌟🌟
* Add note: “Each week, your heart expands through awareness and action.” 

🪶 3️⃣ ActionLogger.tsx — Weekly Reflection
* Dropdowns for Cycle (1–3) and Week (1–4)
* Fields:
    * Actions
    * Learnings
    * Wins
* “Save Reflection” button
* Sunday reminder text: “Reflect with your heart every Sunday 💚” 

🌟 4️⃣ StarProgress.tsx — Golden Growth Tracker
* Circular star progress tracker (like halo animation).
* Example text: “You’ve earned 33 Stars ✨ Keep glowing, Champion!” 
* Star milestones:
    * Set POH → ⭐
    * Plan Journey → ⭐
    * Complete Cycle 1 → ⭐⭐
    * Complete Cycle 2 → ⭐⭐
    * Complete Cycle 3 + Reflection → 🏅 Golden Star
* Add subtle twinkling stars and soft heartbeat pulse behind the star counter.

💭 5️⃣ SelfEvaluationCard.tsx — Optional Reflection Card
* Add as a separate card on the POH Dashboard with a title: “🪞 Self-Evaluation (Optional)”
* User can expand this card if they wish to reflect (optional).
Questions (each in beautiful text boxes):
1. What was my Project of Heart?
2. What tangible results was I looking for?
3. What were my challenges?
4. What actionable steps did I take?
5. What results did I get?
6. What are my learnings?
7. What are my wins?
8. What have I achieved?
Footer quote (centered in italics):
“When we start, we are one person; months later, we are someone new. Reflection opens new doors and visions.”
On submit:
* Show toast: “Reflection Complete 🌟”
* Award Golden Star
* Save to localStorage
If skipped, the journey still continues normally.

🧾 6️⃣ CertificateGenerator.tsx — Handwritten Completion Certificate
* On completing all cycles (and optional reflection):
    * Generate a personalized PDF certificate with signature “Dr.M”
    * Include name, stars earned, and completion message
    * Quote: “With an open heart, you completed your Project of Heart.” 
    * Download PDF button
* Certificate border in rose-gold with faint green glow (heart chakra aura).

🕉 7️⃣ HeartChakraDisplay.tsx — Spiritual Touch
* Add a small animated heart chakra symbol (💚 Anahata mandala)
    * Place it subtly near the top-right corner or below Vision Board.
    * Use a gentle rotating glow animation — emerald-green aura pulsing softly.
    * Tooltip: “Heart Chakra – Center of Love, Balance, and Purpose.”
* Optional info box: “Your Project of Heart aligns with the Anahata — the heart chakra, the bridge between physical and spiritual growth.” 

🏆 8️⃣ ChampionBoard.tsx — Champions of DYD Sessions
