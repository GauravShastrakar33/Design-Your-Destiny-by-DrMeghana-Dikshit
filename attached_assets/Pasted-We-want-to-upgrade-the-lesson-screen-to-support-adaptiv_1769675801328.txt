We want to upgrade the lesson screen to support adaptive multi-resource lessons WITHOUT removing the existing lesson journey UI.

Each lesson may include:
- video
- audio
- script PDF

Currently the UI assumes video-only. We need dynamic rendering based on available content while preserving the existing lesson flow and journey list.

--------------------------------
CORE PLAYER LOGIC
--------------------------------

1. If video exists → show video player at the top (primary experience)
2. Else if audio exists → show audio player at the top
3. Else → show a PDF-only lesson view

When BOTH video and audio exist:
- video remains the primary player
- audio appears as an optional alternate format in Resources

The lesson screen must NEVER show:
- empty player area
- video errors if video is missing
- broken UI states

--------------------------------
RESOURCE SECTION
--------------------------------

Directly BELOW the player, insert a section titled:

"Resources"

Render conditionally:

- If script PDF exists:
  show row → "Script (PDF)"
  tapping opens PDF in in-app viewer or new tab

- If audio exists AND video exists:
  show row → "Audio Version"
  tapping opens audio player

Only show resources that exist.
Do not auto-download files.
Do not autoplay audio when video is active.

--------------------------------
EXISTING LESSON JOURNEY UI
--------------------------------

After the Resources section:
- Keep the existing lesson journey list exactly as implemented
- Do NOT remove or redesign the Day 1 / Day 2 / locked lessons UI
- Resources should appear ABOVE the journey list
- The journey remains the main navigation system

--------------------------------
UI RULES
--------------------------------

- Screen must adapt based on lesson content
- No placeholder errors
- No empty UI states
- Layout should feel intentional whether lesson is:
  video-only
  audio-only
  PDF-only
  mixed content

--------------------------------
GOAL
--------------------------------

Users should see:

Player
→ Resources
→ Lesson Journey

in that order.

All lesson materials must be accessible from one clean screen while preserving the existing challenge flow.
