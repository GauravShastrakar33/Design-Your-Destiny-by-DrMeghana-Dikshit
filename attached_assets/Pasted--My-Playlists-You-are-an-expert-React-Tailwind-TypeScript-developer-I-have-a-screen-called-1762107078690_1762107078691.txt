### My Playlists

You are an expert React + Tailwind + TypeScript developer.

I have a screen called `MyPracticePlaylistPage` where users can expand a playlist and see the list of practices they added. Right now, I am rendering an AudioPlayer for every practice, but I want to change it.

🎧 I want this exact behavior:
✅ Show only the list of practice names inside the expanded playlist (no multiple audio players).
✅ When user clicks the Play button for the playlist:
   - Start playing the FIRST audio in the playlist.
   - Use a SINGLE AudioPlayer component below the playlist.
   - After one audio finishes, automatically play the NEXT audio in the playlist.
   - When the last audio finishes, stop playback.
✅ Audio files must be loaded from `audioLibrary.js` using practice title matching.
✅ AudioPlayer should support:
   - Play / Pause
   - Progress bar
   - Current time / Total duration
   - Speed control (1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x)
✅ For now, no progress tracking API is required (just sequential playback).

Here is my `audioLibrary.js` (must be used exactly as below):

export const audioLibrary = {
  practices: [
    { id: 2, title: "Vibration Elevation", file: "/audios/VibrationElevation.mp3" },
    { id: 3, title: "Neurolinking", file: "/audios/Neurolinking.mp3" },
    { id: 10, title: "Wealth Code Activation 1", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation1.mp3" },
    { id: 11, title: "Wealth Code Activation 2", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation2.mp3" },
  ],
  affirmations: [
    { id: "aff1", title: "Memory Development Breath", file: "/audios/MemoryDevelopmentBreath.mp3" }
  ],
};

🎯 What to do:
1. Modify `MyPracticePlaylistPage`:
   - Map only practice names.
   - Add state: currentTrackIndex, isPlaying.
   - On Play button → set currentTrackIndex = 0 and isPlaying = true.
2. Insert ONE <AudioPlayer /> below the playlist when isPlaying is true.
3. Pass the correct audio src like:
   const currentAudio = audioLibrary.practices.find(a => a.title === playlist.practices[currentTrackIndex]);
4. In <AudioPlayer />, when audio ends (@onEnded), go to next track:
   if (currentTrackIndex < playlist.practices.length - 1) setCurrentTrackIndex(prev => prev + 1)
   else stop and reset.
5. Keep reminder/delete logic untouched.

✅ Return only the updated code parts (AudioPlayer + MyPracticePlaylistPage modifications).
✅ Styling must be clean and follow the current UI.



### Music Journaling

You are a React + TypeScript + Tailwind expert.

I have a Music Journaling page where I want to add an audio player for each journaling track. 
I’m using a reusable <AudioPlayer /> component in other parts of my app, and I want to use the same here.

------------------------------------------------
✅ My audio source is from audioLibrary.ts (not a local array):
------------------------------------------------
export interface AudioItem {
  id: number | string;
  title: string;
  file: string;
}

export const audioLibrary = {
  practices: [
    { id: 2, title: "Vibration Elevation", file: "/audios/VibrationElevation.mp3" },
    { id: 3, title: "Neurolinking", file: "/audios/Neurolinking.mp3" },
    { id: 10, title: "Wealth Code Activation 1", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation1.mp3" },
    { id: 11, title: "Wealth Code Activation 2", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation2.mp3" },
  ],
  affirmations: [
    { id: "aff1", title: "Memory Development Breath", file: "/audios/MemoryDevelopmentBreath.mp3" }
  ],
  journalingAudios: [
    { id: 1, title: "Deep Theta Music", file: "/audios/ThetaMusic1.mp3" },
    // Add more later...
  ],
};

------------------------------------------------
✅ What I want you to do in MusicJournalingPage:
------------------------------------------------
1. Import and load tracks from audioLibrary.journalingAudios instead of hardcoding an array.
2. Render a card UI like my screenshot:
   • Large circular Play/Pause button  
   • Title and optional subtitle/description  
   • Duration & progress bar
3. Use only ONE audio playing at a time:
   • If a user clicks Play on a track → stop any other playing track  
   • Keep track of current playing track with `currentTrackId` and `setCurrentTrackId`
4. Use my existing <AudioPlayer /> component for actual audio logic:
   <AudioPlayer
     src={track.file}
     title={track.title}
     mode="basic"
     isActive={currentTrackId === track.id}
     onPlay={() => setCurrentTrackId(track.id)}
     onEnded={() => setCurrentTrackId(null)}
   />
5. Do not show multiple AudioPlayers stacked — embed inside each journaling card UI layout.
6. (Optional but preferred) Add speed controls like: 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x.

------------------------------------------------
✅ Output Required:
------------------------------------------------
✔ Updated MusicJournalingPage code using audioLibrary.journalingAudios  
✔ Integration of <AudioPlayer /> in each card  
✔ Logic for only one track playing at a time  
✔ No extra explanations — return only clean updated code.
