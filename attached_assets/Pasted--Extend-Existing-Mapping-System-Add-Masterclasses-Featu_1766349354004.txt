🚀 Extend Existing Mapping System — Add Masterclasses Feature

Context:
This project already has:
- CMS (courses, modules, lessons, lesson_files)
- Mapping layer (frontend_features + feature_course_map)
- Admin mapping pages for Processes, Spiritual Breaths, Abundance Mastery
- Public API: GET /public/v1/features/:code
- User app home screen has a Masterclasses card (currently placeholder)

Goal:
Enable admin to control which CMS courses appear in the Masterclasses section of the user app.

🎯 Feature Definition

Feature Code: MASTERCLASS  
Display Mode: courses  
Mapping Rule: Admin selects MANY CMS courses (ordered)

Do NOT:
- Use program_code
- Modify CMS tables
- Add lesson/module-level mapping

🧱 Backend Changes (Drizzle)

1️⃣ frontend_features  
Seed a new row:
- code: MASTERCLASS
- display_name: Masterclasses
- display_mode: courses

2️⃣ feature_course_map  
Reuse existing table:
- Allow multiple courses
- Allow reorder
- Same behavior as ABUNDANCE (but without built-ins)

🔌 Admin API (reuse existing endpoints)

Support feature code MASTERCLASS in:
- GET    /admin/v1/frontend-mapping/features
- GET    /admin/v1/frontend-mapping/features/MASTERCLASS/courses
- POST   /admin/v1/frontend-mapping/features/MASTERCLASS/courses
- PATCH  /admin/v1/frontend-mapping/features/MASTERCLASS/courses/reorder
- DELETE /admin/v1/frontend-mapping/features/MASTERCLASS/courses/:courseId

🌍 Public API

Use existing endpoint:
GET /public/v1/features/MASTERCLASS

Return:
- Ordered list of mapped CMS courses

🖥️ Admin Panel (React)

Add a new submenu:
Process Library → Masterclasses

Create page:
client/src/pages/Masterclasses/index.tsx

UI requirements:
- Header: Masterclasses
- Helper text: “Select CMS courses to show under Masterclasses in the app.”
- Dropdown to add CMS course
- List of added courses
- Drag & drop reorder
- Remove course

Reuse same UI patterns/components used in Abundance Mastery mapping.

📁 Files

Backend:
- server/db/schema/mapping.ts (seed MASTERCLASS)
- server/controllers/frontendMappingController.ts (support MASTERCLASS)
- server/routes/admin/frontend-mapping/index.ts

🧪 Acceptance Criteria

- Admin can add/remove/reorder CMS courses under Masterclasses
- User app fetches courses via /public/v1/features/MASTERCLASS
- Masterclasses card shows only admin-selected courses
- No CMS schema changes
- No program_code usage
