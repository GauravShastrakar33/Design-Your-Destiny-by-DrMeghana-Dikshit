### Home Screen  Money Mastery Hub -> 
Remove the existing money calendar
Create a card name it as Money calendar - its a top card
Build a money calendar feature in Money Calendar card
Build a Money Calendar feature using React + Tailwind.
Requirements:
1. Show a month calendar grid (1 to 30/31 depending on month)
2. Each day cell: • shows the date • if earning exists, show amount • color intensity increases with higher earning • click opens modal for adding/editing amount
3. Modal has: • input for amount • “Save” button • “Delete” if amount already exists
4. Store earnings in localStorage using a structure like:
{
  "2025-10-01": 400,
  "2025-10-02": 850
}
5. Include Previous Month / Next Month navigation
6. Add a Monthly Summary section with: (add some dummy data for now) • Total earnings (in Rupee) • Highest earning day • Average per day
7. Use clean UI with Tailwind classes
8. Organize code into these components: • MoneyCalendar (main) • DayCell • EarningModal • MonthlySummary
9. Use today’s date to automatically highlight current day

Optional styling: • Smooth modal animation • Light green palette for positive financial feeling

Deliverables: • Persistent localStorage logic • Helper functions for handling dates and totals • Minimal dummy design that I can enhance later



### Workshops screen

Latest tab → Card with thumbnail and title “How to make Right Decisions”

I have uploaded a video named:

How to make Right Decisions.mp4

Please move this file into the project’s `public` folder so it is accessible at:

/How to make Right Decisions.mp4

Then, in WorkshopsPage.tsx, update ONLY the card with:

title: "How to make Right Decisions"

Replace ONLY the url property in that card with:

url: "/How to make Right Decisions.mp4"

Remove the old YouTube/video URL.

When I click that card in the Latest tab, it should go to VideoPlayerPage and the ReactPlayer must load and play this local MP4 file when I press Play.


### Project of heart


### layout

Refine the layout of the Project of Heart screen to make it more compact and visually balanced — keeping all design and content exactly the same. Apply only spacing and alignment improvements as follows:
🔧 Requirements
1. Header Section
* Keep “Project of Heart” title and subtitle intact.
* Make 💚 green heart slightly higher, so the subtitle "Your heart's purpose, guided by love and discipline" appears in a single line below it.
2. Your Growth Card
* Do not change any content or visual style.
* Just make the card more compact by reducing padding:
    * Outer container: pt-8 → pt-4, pb-4 → pb-3
    * Card padding: p-5 → p-4
    * Inside spacing: reduce space-y-4 → space-y-2
* Reduce any unnecessary top margin on the star circle (mt-3 → mt-1).
3. Tabs (Vision / Journey / Reflect)
* Move the tab section closer to the Growth card by reducing margin-top:
    * mt-6 → mt-2 or mt-3
* Keep their layout and styling exactly as is (no color or design change).
4. Below Cards (Vision, Journey, Reflect Content)
* Bring all cards slightly up to follow the new compact spacing:
    * Change section wrapper margin: mt-6 → mt-3
5. Overall Section Alignment
* Maintain consistent, compact vertical spacing between sections:
    * Wrapper around cards and tabs should use space-y-3 instead of space-y-5.
* Ensure the visual flow is: Header → Growth Card → Tabs → Vision Card → Other Cards, with smooth, proportional spacing.


### vision tab

Add a horizontal 4-image gallery feature inside the existing “Your Vision” card in the Vision tab.
Requirements
1. The image gallery must be inside the Vision card, above the Vision description.
2. Display up to four images side-by-side, scrollable horizontally with smooth swipe support on mobile.
3. Images must be:
    * Rounded rectangle shape
    * Equal height
    * Soft shadow
    * object-fit: cover
4. The layout must stay aligned with the current Vision card styling and spacing.
5. Store uploaded images in React state (later can sync with localStorage or backend).
6. The card order should be:
    * Vision title + existing Edit button
    * New horizontal image gallery
    * Existing vision description text
    * Existing affirmation quote section

Editing Behavior
The same Edit button should manage images and text together.
On clicking Edit:
* Enable edit modal or inline edit mode that allows:
    * Updating Vision title and description (already working)
    * Managing the 4 image slots

Image management inside Edit mode:
Action	Result
Tap existing image	Replace image (open picker)
Tap empty slot	Add new image
Tap delete ✕ overlay	Remove image (slot becomes empty)
Rules:
* Maximum 4 images
* Keep empty slots visible as + Add Visions placeholders
On Save:
* Update text + images state
* Close edit mode
On Cancel:
* No changes saved
Component Guidance (React + Tailwind)
The gallery inside the card should use:
* flex
* space-x-3
* overflow-x-auto
* shrink-0
* Hidden scrollbar


### Journey tab in project of heart

Show a “Start Your Journey” action card on top inside journey card
Card Title: “Set Your Action Steps To Begin Cycle 1”
Card Content:
* “What actions will you take this week toward your vision?”
Give them a text box and save option -> after clicking on save give them a good message popup “ ✨ “ Congratulation Champion ! This is your becoming story. Let your actions write the next page.”

After saves -> create a card with written actions on top in the journey card and then put the remaining existing “Cycles of Growth” below.



### user profile screen


Update the profile section design as follows:
* Change the profile picture shape from a circle to a vertical rectangle with rounded corners (12–16px radius).
* Align the profile image and name details neatly, maintaining a clean and modern layout.
* Replace the text “Stars from Dr.M” with “Stars Earned   ⭐ 33” — all on one single line next to the star icon and number.
* Ensure the star icon and number are centered vertically and visually balanced with the name and member info.
* Reduce the vertical padding between the profile card and the Karmic Affirmation card — keep just enough spacing for clarity (~12–16px max).
* Maintain the same color scheme and typography.
* Keep the Karmic Affirmation card style and font as it is.
The result should look compact, elegant, and visually aligned — like a cohesive card stack with reduced white space.
