Redesign and enhance my Holistic Meditation App Home Dashboard UI. Do not remove or overwrite any existing logic or backend code — only improve UI layout and add new screens as described.

### HomeScreen Dashboard

Redesign my  Homescreen UI so the quick action cards appear in a compact grid layout.

Requirements:
* Display at least 8 cards (2 columns × 4 rows) visible without scrolling on a standard phone screen.
* Each card should be smaller in height but still readable and tappable.
* Maintain card icons and titles (like “Processes,” “Spiritual Breaths,” “Community Practices,” “My Playlist,” etc.).
* Layout compact Rectangle cards with minimal spacing.

Below these cards, add the following full-width sections:

1. Motivational Quote Card
* Full-width gradient card with rounded corners.
* Large centered text: “The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.” — Tony Robbins 
* Small button below: “More Quotes →” with a dark translucent background.
* When user clicks: show 3 more motivational quote cards (vertically scrollable).
1. How you do anything is How you do everything - Dr.M
  2.The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. - Tony Robins
3. Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today. - Will Roggers
* Last card should display: “That’s it for today. New Quotes  and Affirmations on a new day. See you tomorrow.” 

2. AI Insights Card
* Full-width gradient card with rounded corners.
* Title: “AI Insights ✨”
* Subtitle: “Receive personalised insights for your streak.”
