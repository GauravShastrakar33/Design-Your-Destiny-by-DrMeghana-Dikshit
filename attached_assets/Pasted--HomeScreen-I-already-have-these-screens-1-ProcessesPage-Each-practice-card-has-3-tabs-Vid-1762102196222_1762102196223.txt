### HomeScreen

I already have these screens:

1. ProcessesPage → Each practice card has 3 tabs: Video | Audio | Script.
   - Under Audio tab, I want to replace the gray placeholder with a real audio player.
   - Audio files come from this audioLibrary.js:

export const audioLibrary = {
  practices: [
    { id: 2, title: "Vibration Elevation", file: "/audios/VibrationElevation.mp3" },
    { id: 3, title: "Neurolinking", file: "/audios/Neurolinking.mp3" },
    { id: 10, title: "Wealth Code Activation 1", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation1.mp3" },
    { id: 11, title: "Wealth Code Activation 2", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation2.mp3" },
  ],
  affirmations: [
    { id: "aff1", title: "Memory Development Breath", file: "/audios/MemoryDevelopmentBreath.mp3" }
  ],
};

2. SpiritualBreathsPage → Under “Guided Affirmation”, I want the same audio player.

-----------------------------------------
🎯 What I Need You To Build
-----------------------------------------

✅ Build a reusable <AudioPlayer /> React component with:
- Props: src, title, mode ("basic" or "playlist"), userId?, audioId?, playlistId?
- UI matching my design:
   • Round play/pause button (same style as screenshot)
   • Progress bar (thin line)
   • Time display like `0:00 / 3:24`
   • Dropdown or button for speed change → 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x
- Use HTML5 <audio> internally, no external heavy audio libraries.
- When mode="basic" → no progress tracking.
- When mode="playlist" → if listener reaches 90%, call POST /api/track-progress.

✅ Usage in ProcessesPage:
   - Inside each practice card, under Audio Tab:
     <AudioPlayer
        src={audioLibrary.practices.find(p => p.id === practice.id)?.file}
        title={practice.title}
        mode="basic"
     />

✅ Usage in SpiritualBreathsPage (Guided Affirmation):
   <AudioPlayer
      src={audioLibrary.affirmations[0].file}
      title="Memory Development Breath"
      mode="basic"
   />

✅ (Later) In Custom Playlist Page:
   <AudioPlayer
      mode="playlist"
      userId="123"
      playlistId="myPlaylist1"
      audioId={audio.id}
      src={audio.file}
   />

-----------------------------------------
📦 Output Required:
-----------------------------------------
1. ✅ AudioPlayer.tsx (React + Tailwind)
2. ✅ Example integration in ProcessesPage (inside Audio Tab)
3. ✅ Example integration in SpiritualBreathsPage (Guided Affirmation section)
4. ✅ Add speed controls + working seek + duration

Keep the code clean, modular, and responsive for mobile.

### My Playlists

I have this existing React component for displaying my saved custom playlists (MyPracticePlaylistPage). It currently shows only strings for each practice name in a playlist like "Vibration Elevation", "Neurolinking", etc.

I also have an audioLibrary.js file:

export const audioLibrary = {
  practices: [
    { id: 2, title: "Vibration Elevation", file: "/audios/VibrationElevation.mp3" },
    { id: 3, title: "Neurolinking", file: "/audios/Neurolinking.mp3" },
    { id: 10, title: "Wealth Code Activation 1", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation1.mp3" },
    { id: 11, title: "Wealth Code Activation 2", file: "/audios/WealthCodeActivation2.mp3" },
  ],
  affirmations: [
    { id: "aff1", title: "Memory Development Breath", file: "/audios/MemoryDevelopmentBreath.mp3" }
  ],
};

I want you to modify MyPracticePlaylistPage so that:

1. For each practice inside a playlist, check if it exists inside audioLibrary by matching the title.
2. If an audio file exists, render an <AudioPlayer /> component under that item.
3. The AudioPlayer should receive:
   - src={audio.file}
   - title={audio.title}
   - mode="playlist" (we are not doing progress tracking yet)
4. If no matching audio is found, just show the name as plain text like before.
5. Do not remove existing functionality (delete, reminders, expand/collapse).
6. Keep everything in functional React + TypeScript + Tailwind.

Finally, ONLY modify the part inside:
{playlist.practices.map(...)}
to map names -> audioLibrary -> AudioPlayer.
