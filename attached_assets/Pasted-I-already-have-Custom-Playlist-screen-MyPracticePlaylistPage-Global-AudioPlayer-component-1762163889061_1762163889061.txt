I already have:
✔ Custom Playlist screen (MyPracticePlaylistPage)
✔ Global <AudioPlayer /> component with play, pause, speed, progress
✔ audioLibrary working for loading audios
✔ Music Journaling + Processes pages working

### My Playlist

Now I want to upgrade my Custom Playlist with real user progress tracking and resume feature.

-----------------------------------------
✅ Feature 1: Resume From Where I Left Off
-----------------------------------------
• If user stops listening halfway (example: 8:15 in track 2), the next time they open the playlist:
   → It should automatically start from the same track and timestamp.
• If user completes 2 out of 6 audios, next time it should begin from the 3rd.
• Save resume info in localStorage like this:

localStorage.setItem('playlistProgress', JSON.stringify({
  playlistId: "GauravsMorningPlaylist",
  currentTrackId: "Neurolinking",
  currentTime: 495  // in seconds
}));

• On playlist load:
   → Read localStorage
   → If playlistId matches, auto-set currentTrackIndex + audio.currentTime.

-----------------------------------------
✅ Feature 2: Track Audio Completion (90% Rule)
-----------------------------------------
• If user listens to ≥ 90% of an audio in a playlist → mark it as "completed".
• Store per-day completion like:

localStorage.setItem('playlistStats', JSON.stringify({
  "2025-11-03": {
    playlistId: "GauravsMorningPlaylist",
    completedTracks: ["Vibration Elevation", "Neurolinking"],
    totalTracks: 6,
    dayCompleted: false
  }
}));

• Logic:
   → In <AudioPlayer />, when (currentTime / duration) >= 0.9 → call markTrackComplete(trackId, playlistId)
   → Push into completedTracks for today
   → If completedTracks.length === totalTracks → set dayCompleted: true

-----------------------------------------
⚙️ VERY IMPORTANT: Use AudioPlayer modes
-----------------------------------------
- <AudioPlayer /> already has `mode="basic"` and `mode="playlist"`

- `mode="basic"` = ONLY plays audio, NO tracking, NO saving progress  
- `mode="playlist"` = MUST track and save:
    ✔ Save current track + timestamp to localStorage (resume feature)
    ✔ Detect 90% completion and mark track complete
    ✔ Update playlistStats for challenges/insights

So:
• Music Journaling, Processes, Affirmations → use mode="basic"
• Custom Playlist → use mode="playlist"

-----------------------------------------
⚙️ Technical Instructions
-----------------------------------------
Modify these files:
- MyPracticePlaylistPage.tsx
- AudioPlayer.tsx
- utils/storage.ts (or /lib/storage.ts) → add:
    • saveProgress(playlistId, trackId, time)
    • loadProgress(playlistId)
    • markTrackComplete(playlistId, trackId)
    • getDailyStats()

In <AudioPlayer /> component:
- Add new props:
    onProgressUpdate?(time: number, duration: number)
    onComplete?()
- Inside <audio> element:
    onTimeUpdate={() => onProgressUpdate?.(audio.currentTime, audio.duration)}
- If mode === "playlist" and (currentTime / duration >= 0.9), call onComplete()
