PROJECT OF HEART (COMPLETE UI / UX FLOW)
Context
We are implementing the complete user-side UI & UX flow for a feature called Project of Heart (POH).
* Backend APIs are already implemented and must be used as-is
* Database schema is finalized
* Vision image upload via Cloudflare R2 is implemented
* Current UI exists but is partially non-interactive
Your task is to:
* Make the UI fully interactive
* Wire all interactions to existing APIs
* Respect all backend rules and constraints
* Preserve the current visual design and layout
⚠️ Do NOT redesign UI. ⚠️ Do NOT change backend APIs.

🌍 GLOBAL UI RULES
* Single scrolling screen
* No tabs
* No locks
* Calm, grounded interactions
* Minimal animations only where explicitly stated

🟢 STATE HANDLING (VERY IMPORTANT)
If user has NO ACTIVE POH
Show Start Screen:
* Heart Chakra context
* Copy explaining Project of Heart
* Single CTA: “Create My Project of Heart”
Creation flow:
1. Select category (career / health / relationships / wealth / other) when user selects other he will write his own category.
2. Enter POH title (identity-based, max 120 chars) - Prompt - For this phase of my life, this one thing matters most.
3. Enter “Why this matters” (max 500 chars)
4. Submit → create ACTIVE POH
5. Seamless transition into main POH screen

With  Above - Heart Chakra Context  below  - My Project of Heart Card


🟢 ACTIVE POH MAIN SCREEN — INTERACTIONS

My Project of Heart Card = (Active POH + Vision + Milestones is one card)

Now Main POH Screen shows 

———————————————————————
1️⃣ Active POH (Identity Section) 

MY PROJECT OF HEART         ACTIVE
Category

Title - set by user 
Why this matters to my heart
Set by user

Vision

2️⃣ Vision Section (Optional)
* 3 fixed slots
* 0–3 images allowed
* Click empty slot → image picker
* Click existing image → replace image
* Upload via /api/poh/:id/vision
* Show loading state per slot

3️⃣ Milestones (ACTIVE POH ONLY)
[Create Milestones] - button 
When user clicks on it open a modal 
Modal - user can create max 5 milestones - (1,2,3,4,5 anything is accepted)
When he creates milestones 
Display:

* ● = achieved
* Order remains fixed


Editing milestones
* Editable only if:
    * POH is ACTIVE
    * milestone not achieved
* Achieved milestones show no edit option

⭐ MILESTONE ACCOMPLISHMENT (IMPORTANT)
When user clicks an unachieved milestone:
1. Show confirmation modal: ————————————————————— This milestone reflects a shift in you. Mark it when it feels true.  [Not yet]       [It’s ready to be marked]     ————————————————————— 
2. On click  [It’s ready to be marked]   confirm:
    * Call /api/poh/milestone/:id/achieve
    * Trigger accomplishment animation 
Accomplishment Animation Requirements
* Subtle but emotionally rewarding
* Suggested behavior:
    * ○ smoothly morphs to Milestone icon
    * Soft glow or pulse around the milestone
    * Brief scale-up (1.05x → normal)
* Duration: ~600–800ms


After milestone accomplished keep the order and list same
——————————————————-

🔄 COMPLETE / CLOSE ACTIVE POH - button
Trigger:
* Button at bottom of Active POH card section - below milestones
Flow:
1. Modal with options:
    * Complete Project
    * Close Early
2. Require reflection textarea (min 20 chars)
3. Submit:
    * Call /api/poh/:id/complete or /close
    * Backend handles promotion
4. Give a good animation for completion of POH
5. Then switch NEXT POH to main POH and NORTH STAR to NEXT POH

If user has:
* Only Active → only one option appears
* Active + Next → two options
* All three → all options
No empty placeholders.

🔐 RULES PER OPTION (IMPORTANT)

🟢 ACTIVE POH
* Can edit title
*  Can edit “Why”
* Can edit category
* Can edit Milestones

🔵 NEXT POH
* ✅ Edit title
* ✅ Edit category

🌕 NORTH STAR
* ✅ Edit title
* ✅ Edit category  🔄 UI TERMINOLOGY UPDATE — IMPORTANT CONTEXT
* I’ve updated the user-facing terminology for the Project of Heart feature.
* Change summary
* The concept previously referred to as “Horizon / On the Horizon” should now be displayed to users as “North Star”.
* This is a UI / copy change only.
* Backend logic, enums, tables, and API status values remain unchanged (status = "horizon").
* 
* ✅ WHAT TO UPDATE (UI ONLY)
* Please update all visible UI text, labels, badges, headings, and modal copy as follows:
Old UI Text	New UI Text
Horizon	North Star
On the Horizon	North Star
Create Horizon POH	Create North Star
Save to Horizon	Save as North Star
Horizon Project	North Star Project
Horizon (badge)	NORTH STAR (badge)
* 🧠 INTENT (IMPORTANT)
* “North Star” represents a long-term guiding direction, not something to act on immediately.
* UI language should:
* Feel timeless
* Remove urgency
* Avoid “near future” or “someday” phrasing

———————————————————————————————————————————————

												Below Re-align -> 
						View past Projects 	
When clicked it takes to - POH HISTORY SCREEN 

📜 POH HISTORY SCREEN
Separate screen.
Display per POH:
* Title
* Category
* Status
* Date range
* Achieved milestones only
* Closing reflection
Do NOT show:
* Daily ratings
* Actions
* Missed milestones

🔒 UI GUARDS (MANDATORY)
Disable or block UI actions when backend rejects:
* Editing achieved milestones
* Adding milestones beyond limit
* Rating on past date
* Uploading vision images for non-active POH
Show simple inline error text only.

🚫 DO NOT ADD
* Streaks
* Rewards
* Charts
* Progress bars

✅ FINAL EXPECTATION
After this implementation:
* POH feels intentional and alive
* Milestone achievement feels meaningful
* UI reflects backend truth at all times
* Experience stays calm, grounded, and human
