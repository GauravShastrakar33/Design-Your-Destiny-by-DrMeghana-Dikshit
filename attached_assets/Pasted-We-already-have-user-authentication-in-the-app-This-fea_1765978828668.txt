We already have user authentication in the app. This feature must be user-specific, not global.
Please implement the Rewiring Belief feature using the authenticated user_id.

🗄️ Database Design
Create a table called rewiring_beliefs.

CREATE TABLE rewiring_beliefs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  limiting_belief TEXT NOT NULL,
  uplifting_belief TEXT NOT NULL,

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
Rules:
* Every belief pair belongs to one user
* Users can only access their own beliefs

🔌 API Endpoints (Auth Required)
All APIs must use the authenticated user from the request context.

1️⃣ Get all rewiring beliefs (user-specific)

GET /api/v1/rewiring-beliefs
Logic:
* Read user_id from auth session / middleware
* Return only beliefs created by this user
* Order by created_at DESC

SELECT * FROM rewiring_beliefs
WHERE user_id = :userId
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

2️⃣ Create a new belief pair

POST /api/v1/rewiring-beliefs
Body:

{
  "limitingBelief": "Money doesn't grow on trees",
  "upliftingBelief": "Money is abundant and flows freely to me"
}
Logic:
* Attach authenticated user_id
* Save belief pair

3️⃣ Update an existing belief

PUT /api/v1/rewiring-beliefs/:id
Rules:
* User can update only their own belief
* Validate user_id + id

4️⃣ Delete a belief

DELETE /api/v1/rewiring-beliefs/:id
Rules:
* User can delete only their own belief

🖥️ Frontend – Rewiring Belief Screen
Update the Rewiring Belief screen to:
* Fetch beliefs from GET /api/v1/rewiring-beliefs
* Remove all localStorage usage
* Support:
    * Add belief
    * Edit belief
    * Delete belief
* Re-render list after create/update/delete

🌞 Daily Abundance Page Integration
On the Daily Abundance page, below the Money Calendar:
* Fetch the same API: GET /api/v1/rewiring-beliefs
* Display the user’s belief cards below the calendar
* User can select/dissect the card they want on daily abundance page, keep remaining in Rewiring Belief feature.
* Make the card as per the app theme.
* Highlight the most recently created belief at the top
⚠️ Do NOT create a new table for Daily Abundance This page must reuse the same rewiring_beliefs data.

🔐 Security & Constraints
* All APIs must be protected by authentication
* Enforce user_id filtering at query level
* No global/shared belief data

✅ Acceptance Criteria
* Each user sees only their own rewiring beliefs
* Beliefs created in Rewiring screen automatically appear on Daily Abundance page
* No duplication of tables or logic
* Clean, scalable implementation
