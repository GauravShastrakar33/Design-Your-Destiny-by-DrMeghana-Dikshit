I want to update ONLY the design/layout of my Project of Heart (POH) card. Do not change, break, or remove any functionality, logic, props, state, data, or handlers. This is a visual/UI restructure only.
Important: Keep the existing progress ring exactly as it is. Do not remove it.
Apply these design changes inside the POH card:

✅ 1. Remove the small header text at the top (like “Keep glowing, Champion!” or “1 Stars ✨”).

✅ 2. Create a clean two-column section at the top of the card:
LEFT SIDE (70% width):
* Keep the glowing Heart Chakra icon.
* Add Chakra title text: “Heart Chakra – Anahata 💚” (bold, dark text)
* Add a short description under it (small, gray text): “Center of Love, Balance, and Purpose. Your Project of Heart aligns with the bridge between physical and spiritual growth.”
* Make text left-aligned.
RIGHT SIDE (30% width):
* Add a big gold star icon (approx 40–48px, looks like a reward star)
* Under it, show the user’s star count using the existing value: {pohData.stars}
* Make this block vertically centered relative to the left text.

✅ 3. DO NOT remove or modify the existing progress ring at the top of the screen.
It should stay exactly where it is. Just redesign the card beneath it.

✅ 4. Keep the Star Milestones list exactly the same:
* “Set PROJECT OF HEART” – ⭐
* “Complete Cycle 1” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐
* “Complete Cycle 2” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
* “Complete Cycle 3” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Only visually align and clean it if needed; don’t change the data.

📌 Layout goal (visual reference):

[ glowing heart icon ]  Heart Chakra – Anahata         [ ⭐ big gold star ]
                        Chakra description text           [  star count     ]
* Left = Chakra identity
* Right = Achievement star visual
* Milestones remain below

⚠️ Critical instructions:
* Do NOT modify any business logic.
* Do NOT change any variables, hooks, props, states, or data structure.
* Do NOT touch the progress ring component.
* Do NOT change when or how stars are earned.
* Only reorganize JSX + classes to achieve the new visual layout.
