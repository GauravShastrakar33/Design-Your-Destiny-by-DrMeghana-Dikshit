### AIInsights screen
Modify AIInsightsPage.tsx

🎯 Purpose:
This page will show the user's weekly and monthly progress in a simple and inspiring way based only on:
• Custom Playlists (audio practices played)
• My Process Checklist (self-practices completed)

There should be a toggle at the top:  
[ Weekly View ]   [ Monthly View ]

--------------------------------------

✅ Weekly View should contain:

📌 Section 1: Custom Playlists (for each playlist user has)
Example layout:

🎧 Gaurav’s Morning Playlist  
Weekly Activity:
(7-day bar graph like the image I have attached)  
Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun  
▮  ▯  ▯  ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯

Most Practiced:
• Vibration Elevation (3×)  
• Wealth Code Activation 1 (2×)

📌 Section 2: My Process Checklist – Weekly Summary
Example:

✅ My Process Checklist  
Practices Done on X days this week

Most Done:
• Gratitude Journal (3×)  
• Recognition (2×)  
• Mirror Work (1×)

No strict score like “3 of 7 completed”, just counts.

--------------------------------------

Monthly View:

Show Monthly Progress for:
• Custom Playlists (all user-created playlists)
• My Process Checklist (self practices)

Goal: Show Monthly Progress inside ONE card that includes:
✔ All playlists combined (grouped by practice)
✔ All self-practices from My Process Checklist
✔ Display each as a horizontal bar with count
✔ Show practice name + bar + count
✔ Soft and minimal UI, no multiple cards
✔ No harsh colors — use light pastel, Tailwind neutral gradients, smooth rounded bars

-----------------------------
UI Layout (Mobile-first):

<Card class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm p-5">
  
  📅 <Month Name> Progress (October 2025)

  🎧 Playlist Practices
  (show only practices user actually did this month)
  Example:
  Vibration Elevation        ▓▓▓▓▓▓   6×
  Wealth Code Activation 1   ▓▓▓▓▓    5×
  Birth Story Healing        ▓▓▓▓     3×

  ✅ Process Checklist 
  Gratitude Journal          ▓▓▓▓▓    5×
  Recognition                ▓▓▓▓     4×
  Mirror Work                ▓▓       2×

  ✨ “You came back again and again. That’s growth.”
</Card>

Horizontal Bar Component Requirements:
Create a reusable <HorizontalBar /> component:
• Outer bar: `w-full bg-gray-200 h-3 rounded-full`
• Inner bar:
   - width = (count / maxCount) * 100%
   - `h-3 rounded-full transition-all duration-500`
   - Soft gradient colors (example: `bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-300 to-purple-500`)
• Layout per row:
   Practice name (left) — Count (right)
   Bar underneath the text

--------------------------------------

🧠 Data:
Load data from localStorage or mock JSON:

localStorage.userChecklist = ["Gratitude Journal", "Mirror Work", ...]  
localStorage.dailyLogs = [
  { date: "2025-02-10", type: "playlist", playlist: "Gaurav’s Morning Playlist", practice: "Vibration Elevation" },
  { date: "2025-02-10", type: "checklist", practice: "Gratitude Journal" },
]

Filter by:
• Last 7 days → Weekly view  
• Current month → Monthly view  
Group and count occurrences accordingly.
